List of TODOs:


low priority:
- TODO: clean up main.py's code for the AUTO functionality

- TODO: create a seperate module containing all data structures or variables used in multiple ther modules

- TODO: create more consistency (like reusing the "labels" list instead of using "labels" and "notes")
    - might not really be necessary


medium priority:

- TODO: create documentation for train.py

- TODO: work on documentation thru out


high priority:

- TODO: work on identifying improvements in the ml algorithm
    - mostly if not completely done

- TODO: start *chord* implementation
    - *find* of *create* new data
    - configure new functionality for chords with the CNN model

- TODO: after chord implementation, start *time-series* implementation
    - identification of multiple notes or chords in succession in one .wav file
    - decide if notes and chords will be differentiated or analyzed as one
    - if possible, try to keep note of rythm along with pitches and chords for tab/sheet implementation

- TODO: after time-series implementation, start *tablature/sheet-music* implementation
    - make the tab-algorithm to go from time-series to tab representation
    - if tablature, rather easy and mostly ignores rythm, emphasis on pitches and chords and the tablature
    - if sheet, more complicated as includes rythm and time signatures
    - figure out gui in tandem with web dev/web gui design

- TODO: cocurrently with tablature implementation, start web-dev with React or Vue
    - figure out gui for tablature with web dev consdieration in mind
    - go from tab-algorithm product (for the tablature or sheet music in time) to (interactive?) web gui


completed:

- TODO: work on identifying improvements in the ml algorithm
    - mostly if not completely done

- work on the so called "validation" function in training.py and incorporate it into the main function
    - add change to "notes" list to match val data instead of all the data
    - DONE
